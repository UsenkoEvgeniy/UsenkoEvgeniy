### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Evgenii
#### I am Java Developer from Saint-Petersburg


I am amazed by the ability to create entire worlds within a program using a limited set of commands, particularly in languages built on the OOP paradigm, such as Java. I strive to apply my knowledge in practice and make a positive impact on the world.

In my pinned repositories, you can find projects that I have either created or contributed to. The majority of them are Java REST services built with Spring Boot or Spring Framework.

## Skills:

Java / Spring Framework / Spring Data / Srping Boot / SQL / Git / PostgreSQL / Hibernate / Maven / JUnit / Docker / JPA
